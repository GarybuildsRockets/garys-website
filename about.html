        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a strong passion for innovation and problem-solving. From a young age, I have been driven by a desire to improve the world around me, which has led me to develop hands-on skills in engineering. This passion has manifested in projects such as repairing my own car, working to purchase my first computer and 3D printer to enhance my technical abilities, and engaging in complex engineering challenges. Since arriving at the university, my aspirations have expanded into new areas, including designing and launching two-stage rockets with my RSO and developing this website to showcase my work. My time at UIUC has further solidified my passion for engineering, and I am eager to continue exploring, learning, and creating solutions that make a meaningful impact.</p>
